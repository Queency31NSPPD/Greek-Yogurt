        <strong>Greek yogurt</strong> is a yogurt that has been strained to
        remove most of its whey, resulting in a thicker consistency than
        unstrained yogurt, while preserving yogurt's distinctive sour taste.
        Like many types of yogurt, strained yogurt is often made from milk that
        has been enriched by boiling off some of its water content, or by adding
        extra butterfat and powdered milk. In Europe and North America, it is
        often made with low-fat or fat-free yogurt. In Iceland a similar product
        named <em>skyr</em> is produced.
