        <strong> Ice cream </strong> is a frozen dessert, typically made from
        milk or cream and flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an
        alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such
        as strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a flavored
        cream base and liquid nitrogen together. Ice cream may be served in
        dishes, for eating with a spoon, or licked from edible wafer cones. Ice
        cream may be served with other dessertsâ€”such as apple pie, or as an
        ingredient in ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, ice cream cakes and
        baked items, such as <em>Baked Alaska</em>.
